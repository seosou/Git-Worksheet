However, the nucleus of the Korean culture is Shamanism, which is a conjuring religious phenomenon. Even though Shamanism belongs to the first page in the history of religions, it has been transmitted to next generations of Korea in different forms, somewhat surviving until today. A possible reason for this may be that Shamanism exhibits a dynamic and selective tradition that has adapted to different religions around it. It may also provide human beings with the blessings that they are deprived of in today’s society. In this study, the origin and development of Shamanism in Korea, including the three dynasties of Silla, Koryo and Yi, were investigated. The primitive forms of ancient beliefs of Koreans as well as the structure of Shamanism and related rituals were described. Information was also provided on Shaman ritualists and the instruments they utilized in rituals.}, journal={International Journal of Korean Humanities and Social Sciences}, author={Chačatrjan, Arevik}, year={2016}, month=nov, pages={55–70} }

  abstract={In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in many fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Compared to traditional machine learning methods, deep learning has a strong learning ability and can make better use of datasets for feature extraction. Because of its practicability, deep learning becomes more and more popular for many researchers to do research works. In this paper, we mainly introduce some advanced neural networks of deep learning and their applications. Besides, we also discuss the limitations and prospects of deep learning.},
